-> What do you understand by Database?
   ANS:-
  ->  DBMS - Database Managment System.
  ->  DBMS is an organaized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and manage.
  ->  Kind of dtabase is inter-related data which store and retrive the set of program data value.
  ->  DBMS also store the data for easily accessed .
  ->  I uderstand by the Dbms is a langauge & Also it work like store the all file value and exite the same data in the storage.
      if data is important and storeage automatically store in it and we can retrive the data .
      for ex:- we have a school register and we have same name in the register in two time so DBMS work like the two same name
      person value store in the data . If the same value data delet by mistack we can retrive it in the storage.
  ->  DBMS database - Mysql, Oracle, dBASE, Microsoft Access etc.
  ->  Database system devloped for large amount of data . Dealing with huge amount data so, ther are two thing optimization:
      1. Storage of data - Database store the lots of duplicate data . it can be remove before storage.
      2. Retrive of data - Databse storing the duplicated data and deleted in the storage , it is important data we can retrive
                           the all data in the storage. (as i say before in school register example.)
  
  
  -> SQL:-

      -> SQL is structure query language.
      -> SQL is langauge of the database. it creat database structure(creation), modify the rows, deletation, feching rows etc.
      -> SQL is the standerd language for Relational databaase, like MySQL, Oracle etc.
      -> SQL allow the user's to access the data and describe the data.
      -> SQL allow to creat the database and drop database and tables.
      -> SQL allow to solve query and creat the database. it benifite for the bussiness use's to store their record in max values. 
      -> Allow to insert data , store the procedure data , users set their permission in the data.
      -> SQL execute the queries of database , retrive the data from database, insert the new record in database.
      -> we can delet the query in the database, also can delet the non useble data in the database.
      -> It easy to learn and hoew we store the all value by the database.
